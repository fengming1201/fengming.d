NAME
       cryptsetup-isLuks - check if a device is a LUKS device

SYNOPSIS
       cryptsetup isLuks [<options>] <device>

DESCRIPTION
       Returns true, if <device> is a LUKS device, false otherwise.

       Use option -v to get human-readable feedback. 'Command successful.' means the device is a LUKS device.

       By specifying --type you may query for specific LUKS version.

       <options> can be [--header, --type, --disable-locks].

OPTIONS
       --verbose, -v
           Print more information on command execution.

       --type <device-type>
           Specifies required device type, for more info read BASIC ACTIONS section in cryptsetup(8).

       --header <device or file storing the LUKS header>
           Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the LUKS header is stored. This option allows one to store ciphertext and LUKS header on different
           devices.

           For commands that change the LUKS header (e.g. luksAddKey), specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as the LUKS device.

       --disable-locks
           Disable lock protection for metadata on disk. This option is valid only for LUKS2 and ignored for other formats.

           WARNING: Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a restricted environment where locking is impossible to perform (where /run directory cannot be
           used).

       --batch-mode, -q
           Suppresses all confirmation questions. Use with care!

           If the --verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option also switches off the passphrase verification.

       --debug or --debug-json
           Run in debug mode with full diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are always prefixed by #.

           If --debug-json is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are printed.

       --version, -V
           Show the program version.

       --usage
           Show short option help.

       --help, -?
           Show help text and default parameters.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs at cryptsetup mailing list <cryptsetup@lists.linux.dev> or in Issues project section <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/issues/new>.

       Please attach output of the failed command with --debug option added.
