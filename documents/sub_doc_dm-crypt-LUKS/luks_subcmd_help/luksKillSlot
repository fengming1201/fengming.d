CRYPTSETUP-LUKSKILLSLOT(8)                                                  Maintenance Commands                                                 CRYPTSETUP-LUKSKILLSLOT(8)

NAME
       cryptsetup-luksKillSlot - wipe a key-slot from the LUKS device

SYNOPSIS
       cryptsetup luksKillSlot [<options>] <device> <key slot number>

DESCRIPTION
       Wipe the key-slot number <key slot> from the LUKS device. Except running in batch-mode (-q) a remaining passphrase must be supplied, either interactively or via
       --key-file. This command can remove the last remaining key-slot, but requires an interactive confirmation when doing so. Removing the last passphrase makes a LUKS
       container permanently inaccessible.

       <options> can be [--key-file, --keyfile-offset, --keyfile-size, --header, --disable-locks, --type, --verify-passphrase, --timeout].

       WARNING: If you read the passphrase from stdin (without further argument or with '-' as an argument to --key-file), batch-mode (-q) will be implicitly switched on
       and no warning will be given when you remove the last remaining passphrase from a LUKS container. Removing the last passphrase makes the LUKS container permanently
       inaccessible.

       NOTE: If there is no passphrase provided (on stdin or through --key-file argument) and batch-mode (-q) is active, the key-slot is removed without any other warning.

OPTIONS
       --type <device-type>
           Specifies required device type, for more info read BASIC ACTIONS section in cryptsetup(8).

       --verify-passphrase, -y
           When interactively asking for a passphrase, ask for it twice and complain if both inputs do not match. Ignored on input from file or stdin.

       --key-file, -d name
           Read the passphrase from file.

           If the name given is "-", then the passphrase will be read from stdin. In this case, reading will not stop at newline characters.

           See section NOTES ON PASSPHRASE PROCESSING in cryptsetup(8) for more information.

       --keyfile-offset value
           Skip value bytes at the beginning of the key file.

       --keyfile-size, -l value
           Read a maximum of value bytes from the key file. The default is to read the whole file up to the compiled-in maximum that can be queried with --help. Supplying
           more data than the compiled-in maximum aborts the operation.

           This option is useful to cut trailing newlines, for example. If --keyfile-offset is also given, the size count starts after the offset.

       --timeout, -t <number of seconds>
           The number of seconds to wait before timeout on passphrase input via terminal. It is relevant every time a passphrase is asked. It has no effect if used in
           conjunction with --key-file.

           This option is useful when the system should not stall if the user does not input a passphrase, e.g. during boot. The default is a value of 0 seconds, which
           means to wait forever.

       --header <device or file storing the LUKS header>
           Use a detached (separated) metadata device or file where the LUKS header is stored. This option allows one to store ciphertext and LUKS header on different
           devices.

           For commands that change the LUKS header (e.g. luksAddKey), specify the device or file with the LUKS header directly as the LUKS device.

       --disable-locks
           Disable lock protection for metadata on disk. This option is valid only for LUKS2 and ignored for other formats.

           WARNING: Do not use this option unless you run cryptsetup in a restricted environment where locking is impossible to perform (where /run directory cannot be
           used).

       --batch-mode, -q
           Suppresses all confirmation questions. Use with care!

           If the --verify-passphrase option is not specified, this option also switches off the passphrase verification.

       --debug or --debug-json
           Run in debug mode with full diagnostic logs. Debug output lines are always prefixed by #.

           If --debug-json is used, additional LUKS2 JSON data structures are printed.

       --version, -V
           Show the program version.

       --usage
           Show short option help.

       --help, -?
           Show help text and default parameters.

REPORTING BUGS
       Report bugs at cryptsetup mailing list <cryptsetup@lists.linux.dev> or in Issues project section <https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/issues/new>.

       Please attach output of the failed command with --debug option added.
