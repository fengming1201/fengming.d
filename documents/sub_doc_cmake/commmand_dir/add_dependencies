add_dependencies
----------------

Add a dependency between top-level targets.

 add_dependencies(<target> [<target-dependency>]...)

Makes a top-level ``<target>`` depend on other top-level targets to
ensure that they build before ``<target>`` does.  A top-level target
is one created by one of the ``add_executable()``,
``add_library()``, or ``add_custom_target()`` commands
(but not targets generated by CMake like ``install``).

Dependencies added to an :ref:`imported target <Imported Targets>`
or an :ref:`interface library <Interface Libraries>` are followed
transitively in its place since the target itself does not build.

See the ``DEPENDS`` option of ``add_custom_target()`` and
``add_custom_command()`` commands for adding file-level
dependencies in custom rules.  See the ``OBJECT_DEPENDS``
source file property to add file-level dependencies to object files.
