add_definitions
---------------

Add -D define flags to the compilation of source files.

 add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

Adds definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the current
directory, whether added before or after this command is invoked, and for
the ones in sub-directories added after. This command can be used to add any
flags, but it is intended to add preprocessor definitions.

.. note::

  This command has been superseded by alternatives:

  * Use ``add_compile_definitions()`` to add preprocessor definitions.
  * Use ``include_directories()`` to add include directories.
  * Use ``add_compile_options()`` to add other options.

Flags beginning in ``-D`` or ``/D`` that look like preprocessor definitions are
automatically added to the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` directory
property for the current directory.  Definitions with non-trivial values
may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of
backwards compatibility.  See documentation of the
``directory``,
``target``,
``source file`` ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
properties for details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific
scopes and configurations.

See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.
