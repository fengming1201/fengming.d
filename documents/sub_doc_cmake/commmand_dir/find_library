find_library
------------

A short-hand signature is:

 find_library (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

The general signature is:

 find_library (
           <VAR>
           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]
           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
           [DOC "cache documentation string"]
           [REQUIRED]
           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
           [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
          )

This command is used to find a library.
A cache entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result
of this command.
If the library is found the result is stored in the variable
and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.
If nothing is found, the result will be ``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``.
The ``REQUIRED`` option stops processing with an error message if nothing
is found, otherwise the search will be attempted again the
next time find_library is invoked with the same variable.

Options include:

``NAMES``
  Specify one or more possible names for the library.

  When using this to specify names with and without a version
  suffix, we recommend specifying the unversioned name first
  so that locally-built packages can be found before those
  provided by distributions.

``HINTS``, ``PATHS``
  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.
  The ``ENV var`` sub-option reads paths from a system environment
  variable.

``PATH_SUFFIXES``
  Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory
  location otherwise considered.

``DOC``
  Specify the documentation string for the ``<VAR>`` cache entry.

``REQUIRED``
  Stop processing with an error message if nothing is found.

If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified, then no additional paths are
added to the search.
If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is not specified, the search process is as follows:

1. If called from within a find module or any other script loaded by a call to
   ``find_package(<PackageName>)``, search prefixes unique to the
   current package being found.  Specifically, look in the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable.
   The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from
   nested find modules or config packages, root paths from the parent's find
   module or config package will be searched after paths from the current
   module or package.  In other words, the search order would be
   ``<CurrentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<CurrentPackage>_ROOT}``,
   ``<ParentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<ParentPackage>_ROOT}``, etc.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.
   See policy ``CMP0074``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable if called from within a find module loaded by ``find_package(<PackageName>)``

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.
   These are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`semicolon-separated lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or
   by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

4. Search the paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.
   These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
   hint provided by the location of another item already found.
   Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or by
   setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * The directories in ``PATH`` and ``INCLUDE``.
   * On Windows hosts: ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` in ``PATH``, and ``<entry>/lib`` for other entries in ``PATH``.

6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
   for the current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   is passed or by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

   The platform paths that these variables contain are locations that
   typically include installed software. An example being ``/usr/local`` for
   UNIX based platforms.

7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option
   or in the short-hand version of the command.
   These are typically hard-coded guesses.

On macOS the ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variables determine the order of
preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

The CMake variable ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` are excluded
from this re-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` is empty.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` are searched, then the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT``
directory is searched, and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY``.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis using options:

``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH``
  Search in the order described above.

``NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Do not use the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` variable.

``ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below
  ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.

The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
least-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the ``NO_*`` options:

 find_library (<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
 find_library (<VAR> NAMES name)

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

When more than one value is given to the ``NAMES`` option this command by
default will consider one name at a time and search every directory
for it.  The ``NAMES_PER_DIR`` option tells this command to consider one
directory at a time and search for all names in it.

Each library name given to the ``NAMES`` option is first considered
as a library file name and then considered with platform-specific
prefixes (e.g. ``lib``) and suffixes (e.g. ``.so``).  Therefore one
may specify library file names such as ``libfoo.a`` directly.
This can be used to locate static libraries on UNIX-like systems.

If the library found is a framework, then ``<VAR>`` will be set to the full
path to the framework ``<fullPath>/A.framework``.  When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a ``-framework A``, and a
``-F<fullPath>`` to link the framework to the target.

If the ``CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX`` variable is set all
search paths will be tested as normal, with the suffix appended, and with
all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with
``lib${CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX}/``.  This variable overrides
the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS``,
``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS``,
and ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS`` global properties.

If the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``32/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``lib32/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the ``project()`` command
is enabled.

If the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``x32/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``libx32/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the ``project()`` command
is enabled.

If the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS`` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``64/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``lib64/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the ``project()`` command
is enabled.
