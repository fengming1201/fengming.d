while
-----

Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

 while(<condition>)
   <commands>
 endwhile()

All commands between while and the matching ``endwhile()`` are recorded
without being invoked.  Once the ``endwhile()`` is evaluated, the
recorded list of commands is invoked as long as the ``<condition>`` is true.

The ``<condition>`` has the same syntax and is evaluated using the same logic
as described at length for the ``if()`` command.

The commands ``break()`` and ``continue()`` provide means to
escape from the normal control flow.

Per legacy, the ``endwhile()`` command admits
an optional ``<condition>`` argument.
If used, it must be a verbatim repeat of the argument of the opening
``while`` command.
