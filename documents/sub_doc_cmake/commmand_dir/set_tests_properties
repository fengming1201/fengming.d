set_tests_properties
--------------------

Set a property of the tests.

 set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

Sets a property for the tests.  If the test is not found, CMake
will report an error.
``Generator expressions`` will be
expanded the same as supported by the test's ``add_test()`` call.

See also the ``set_property(TEST)`` command.

See :ref:`Test Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake.
