get_cmake_property
------------------

Get a global property of the CMake instance.

 get_cmake_property(<var> <property>)

Gets a global property from the CMake instance.  The value of
the ``<property>`` is stored in the variable ``<var>``.
If the property is not found, ``<var>`` will be set to ``NOTFOUND``.
See the ``cmake-properties(7)`` manual for available properties.

See also the ``get_property()`` command ``GLOBAL`` option.

In addition to global properties, this command (for historical reasons)
also supports the ``VARIABLES`` and ``MACROS`` directory
properties.  It also supports a special ``COMPONENTS`` global property that
lists the components given to the ``install()`` command.
