Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list subcommands ``APPEND``, ``INSERT``, ``FILTER``, ``PREPEND``,
``POP_BACK``, ``POP_FRONT``, ``REMOVE_AT``, ``REMOVE_ITEM``,
``REMOVE_DUPLICATES``, ``REVERSE`` and ``SORT`` may create
new values for the list within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to
the ``set()`` command, the LIST command creates new variable values in
the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent
scope.  To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use
``set()`` with ``PARENT_SCOPE``, ``set()`` with
``CACHE INTERNAL``, or some other means of value propagation.

.. note::

  A list in cmake is a ``;`` separated group of strings.  To create a
  list the set command can be used.  For example, ``set(var a b c d e)``
  creates a list with ``a;b;c;d;e``, and ``set(var "a b c d e")`` creates a
  string or a list with one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not
  variables, and therefore cannot be used in LIST commands.)

.. note::

  When specifying index values, if ``<element index>`` is 0 or greater, it
  is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the
  first list element.  If ``<element index>`` is -1 or lesser, it is indexed
  from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element.
  Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from
  0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

Reading
^^^^^^^

 list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)

Returns the list's length.

 list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...] <output variable>)

Returns the list of elements specified by indices from the list.

 list(JOIN <list> <glue> <output variable>)

Returns a string joining all list's elements using the glue string.
To join multiple strings, which are not part of a list, use ``JOIN`` operator
from ``string()`` command.

 list(SUBLIST <list> <begin> <length> <output variable>)

Returns a sublist of the given list.
If ``<length>`` is 0, an empty list will be returned.
If ``<length>`` is -1 or the list is smaller than ``<begin>+<length>`` then
the remaining elements of the list starting at ``<begin>`` will be returned.

Search
^^^^^^

 list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)

Returns the index of the element specified in the list or -1
if it wasn't found.

Modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 list(APPEND <list> [<element> ...])

Appends elements to the list.

 list(FILTER <list> <INCLUDE|EXCLUDE> REGEX <regular_expression>)

Includes or removes items from the list that match the mode's pattern.
In ``REGEX`` mode, items will be matched against the given regular expression.

For more information on regular expressions see also the
``string()`` command.

 list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])

Inserts elements to the list to the specified location.

 list(POP_BACK <list> [<out-var>...])

If no variable name is given, removes exactly one element. Otherwise,
assign the last element's value to the given variable and removes it,
up to the last variable name given.

 list(POP_FRONT <list> [<out-var>...])

If no variable name is given, removes exactly one element. Otherwise,
assign the first element's value to the given variable and removes it,
up to the last variable name given.

 list(PREPEND <list> [<element> ...])

Insert elements to the 0th position in the list.

 list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])

Removes all instances of the given items from the list.

 list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])

Removes items at given indices from the list.

 list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)

Removes duplicated items in the list. The relative order of items is preserved,
but if duplicates are encountered, only the first instance is preserved.

 list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> [<SELECTOR>]
                       [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output variable>])

Transforms the list by applying an action to all or, by specifying a
``<SELECTOR>``, to the selected elements of the list, storing the result
in-place or in the specified output variable.

.. note::

   The ``TRANSFORM`` sub-command does not change the number of elements in the
   list. If a ``<SELECTOR>`` is specified, only some elements will be changed,
   the other ones will remain the same as before the transformation.

``<ACTION>`` specifies the action to apply to the elements of the list.
The actions have exactly the same semantics as sub-commands of the
``string()`` command.  ``<ACTION>`` must be one of the following:

``APPEND``, ``PREPEND``: Append, prepend specified value to each element of
the list.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <APPEND|PREPEND> <value> ...)

``TOUPPER``, ``TOLOWER``: Convert each element of the list to upper, lower
characters.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <TOLOWER|TOUPPER> ...)

``STRIP``: Remove leading and trailing spaces from each element of the
list.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> STRIP ...)

``GENEX_STRIP``: Strip any
``generator expressions`` from each
element of the list.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> GENEX_STRIP ...)

``REPLACE``: Match the regular expression as many times as possible and
substitute the replacement expression for the match for each element
of the list
(Same semantic as ``REGEX REPLACE`` from ``string()`` command).

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> REPLACE <regular_expression>
                                  <replace_expression> ...)

``<SELECTOR>`` determines which elements of the list will be transformed.
Only one type of selector can be specified at a time.  When given,
``<SELECTOR>`` must be one of the following:

``AT``: Specify a list of indexes.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> AT <index> [<index> ...] ...)

``FOR``: Specify a range with, optionally, an increment used to iterate over
the range.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> FOR <start> <stop> [<step>] ...)

``REGEX``: Specify a regular expression. Only elements matching the regular
expression will be transformed.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> REGEX <regular_expression> ...)


Ordering
^^^^^^^^

 list(REVERSE <list>)

Reverses the contents of the list in-place.

 list(SORT <list> [COMPARE <compare>] [CASE <case>] [ORDER <order>])

Sorts the list in-place alphabetically.
Use the ``COMPARE`` keyword to select the comparison method for sorting.
The ``<compare>`` option should be one of:

* ``STRING``: Sorts a list of strings alphabetically.  This is the
  default behavior if the ``COMPARE`` option is not given.
* ``FILE_BASENAME``: Sorts a list of pathnames of files by their basenames.
* ``NATURAL``: Sorts a list of strings using natural order
  (see ``strverscmp(3)`` manual), i.e. such that contiguous digits
  are compared as whole numbers.
  For example: the following list `10.0 1.1 2.1 8.0 2.0 3.1`
  will be sorted as `1.1 2.0 2.1 3.1 8.0 10.0` if the ``NATURAL``
  comparison is selected where it will be sorted as
  `1.1 10.0 2.0 2.1 3.1 8.0` with the ``STRING`` comparison.

Use the ``CASE`` keyword to select a case sensitive or case insensitive
sort mode.  The ``<case>`` option should be one of:

* ``SENSITIVE``: List items are sorted in a case-sensitive manner.  This is
  the default behavior if the ``CASE`` option is not given.
* ``INSENSITIVE``: List items are sorted case insensitively.  The order of
  items which differ only by upper/lowercase is not specified.

To control the sort order, the ``ORDER`` keyword can be given.
The ``<order>`` option should be one of:

* ``ASCENDING``: Sorts the list in ascending order.  This is the default
  behavior when the ``ORDER`` option is not given.
* ``DESCENDING``: Sorts the list in descending order.
