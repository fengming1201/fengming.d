Getting started with Redis

How to get up and running with Redis

This is a guide to getting started with Redis. You'll learn how to install, run, and experiment with the Redis server process.
Install Redis

How you install Redis depends on your operating system and whether you'd like to install it bundled with Redis Stack and Redis UI. See the guide below that best fits your needs:

    Install Redis from Source
    Install Redis on Linux
    Install Redis on macOS
    Install Redis on Windows
    Install Redis with Redis Stack and RedisInsight

Once you have Redis up and running, and can connect using redis-cli, you can continue with the steps below.

{
    Install Redis from Source

    Compile and install Redis from source

    You can compile and install Redis from source on variety of platforms and operating systems including Linux and macOS. Redis has no dependencies other than a C compiler and libc.
    Downloading the source files

    The Redis source files are available from the Download page. You can verify the integrity of these downloads by checking them against the digests in the redis-hashes git repository.

    To obtain the source files for the latest stable version of Redis from the Redis downloads site, run:

    $wget https://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz

    Compiling Redis

    To compile Redis, first the tarball, change to the root directory, and then run make:

    $tar -xzvf redis-stable.tar.gz
    $cd redis-stable
    $make

    If the compile succeeds, you'll find several Redis binaries in the src directory, including:

        redis-server: the Redis Server itself
        redis-cli is the command line interface utility to talk with Redis.

    To install these binaries in /usr/local/bin, run:

    $make install

    Starting and stopping Redis in the foreground

    Once installed, you can start Redis by running

    $redis-server

    If successful, you'll see the startup logs for Redis, and Redis will be running in the foreground.

    To stop Redis, enter Ctrl-C.

    Install Redis on Linux

    How to install Redis on Linux

    Most major Linux distributions provide packages for Redis.
    Install on Ubuntu/Debian

    You can install recent stable versions of Redis from the official packages.redis.io APT repository.
    Prerequisites

    If you're running a very minimal distribution (such as a Docker container) you may need to install lsb-release first:

    $sudo apt install lsb-release

    Add the repository to the apt index, update it, and then install:

    $curl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg

    $echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list

    $sudo apt-get update
    $sudo apt-get install redis

    Install from Snapcraft

    The Snapcraft store provides Redis packages that can be installed on platforms that support snap. Snap is supported and available on most major Linux distributions.

    To install via snap, run:

    $sudo snap install redis

    If your Linux does not currently have snap installed, install it using the instructions described in Installing snapd.
