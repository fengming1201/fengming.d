Step 1: Start the server


Open a terminal and run this command to start the app after replacing ~/Pictures with the folder containing your pictures:

docker run -d \
  --name photoprism \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  --security-opt apparmor=unconfined \
  -p 2342:2342 \
  -e PHOTOPRISM_UPLOAD_NSFW="true" \
  -e PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD="insecure" \
  -v /photoprism/storage \
  -v ~/Pictures:/photoprism/originals \
  photoprism/photoprism

The server port and other config options can be changed as needed. 
If you provide no database server credentials, SQLite database files will be created in the storage folder.

note:Always change PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD so that the app starts with a secure initial password. 
Never use easy-to-guess passwords or default values like insecure on publicly accessible servers. 
There is no default in case no password was provided. A minimum length of 8 characters is required.


When the app has been started, open the Web UI by navigating to http://localhost:2342/. 
You should see a login screen. Sign in with the user admin and the password configured via PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD. 
You may change it on the account settings page. Enabling public mode will disable authentication.

It is not possible to change the password via PHOTOPRISM_ADMIN_PASSWORD after the app has been started for the first time. 
You may run docker exec -ti photoprism photoprism passwd [username] in a terminal to change an existing password. 
You can also reset your database for a clean start.
