
step 1:
Get the Excalidraw Docker Image: Excalidraw provides an official Docker image that you can use to set up a self-hosted instance. Pull the latest Excalidraw Docker image from the Docker Hub using the following command:

#docker pull excalidraw/excalidraw:latest

step 2:
Run Excalidraw Docker Container: Once you have the Excalidraw image, you can run a new Docker container using the following command:

#docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name my-excalidraw-instance excalidraw/excalidraw:latest

This command will create and run a new Excalidraw container, mapping port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your host machine. You can replace “8080” with your desired port number.

step 3:
Access the Self-Hosted Excalidraw Client: After the container is running, you can access the self-hosted Excalidraw client by navigating to http://localhost:8080 (or your chosen port) in your web browser.


Setting up Excalidraw with Docker Compose

You can use the following Docker Compose code to setup Excalidraw. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following contents:
version: '3.3'

services:
  excalidraw:
    image: excalidraw/excalidraw:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3000:80
    container_name: excalidraw

or 
You can easily combine this with a reverse proxy like Traefik to connect using a secure connection. You can do that with example code that looks something like this:

version: "3.8"

services:
  excalidraw:
    build:
      context: .
      args:
        - NODE_ENV=development
    container_name: excalidraw
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    restart: on-failure
    stdin_open: true
    healthcheck:
      disable: true
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    volumes:
      - ./:/opt/node_app/app:delegated
      - ./package.json:/opt/node_app/package.json
      - ./yarn.lock:/opt/node_app/yarn.lock
      - notused:/opt/node_app/app/node_modules

volumes:
  notused:

step 4:
Once you have your docker-compose.yml file created, simply issue the command:

#docker-compose up -d
