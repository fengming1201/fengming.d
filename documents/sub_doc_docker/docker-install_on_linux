
step 0:Uninstall old versions
Older versions of Docker were called docker, docker.io, or docker-engine. If these are installed, uninstall them:
$ sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

The contents of /var/lib/docker/, including images, containers, volumes, and networks, are preserved. 
If you do not need to save your existing data, and want to start with a clean installation, 
refer to the 'uninstall Docker Engine' section at the bottom of this page.

step 2:Installation methods
{
Install using the repository
(1)Set up the repository
1.1. Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
    $ sudo apt-get update

    $ sudo apt-get install \
        ca-certificates \
        curl \
        gnupg \
        lsb-release

1.2. Add Docker’s official GPG key:
	$ sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

1.3. Use the following command to set up the repository:
    $ echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

Note:Receiving a GPG error when running apt-get update?
	Your default umask may not be set correctly, causing the public key file for the repo to not be detected. 
    Run the following command and then try to update your repo again: sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg.

(2)Install Docker Engine
2.1. Update the apt package index, and install the latest version of Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose, or go to the next step to install a specific version:
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-compose-plugin

(3)	Verify 
Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
$ sudo docker run hello-world
}

{
Install from a package
If you cannot use Docker’s repository to install Docker Engine, 
you can download the .deb file for your release and install it manually. 
You need to download a new file each time you want to upgrade Docker.
	1. Go to https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/dists/, 
    choose your Debian version, then browse to pool/stable/, 
    choose amd64, armhf, or arm64, and download the .deb file for the Docker Engine version you want to install.
	
    2. Install Docker Engine, changing the path below to the path where you downloaded the Docker package.
	$ sudo dpkg -i /path/to/package.deb

	The Docker daemon starts automatically.
	3. Verify that Docker Engine is installed correctly by running the hello-world image.
    $ sudo docker run hello-world
